  Most of us need to listen to the music to understand how beautiful it is. But often that’s how we present statistics: we just show the notes, we don’t play the music.

## Who are we?

`IMDAVI` is a group of researchers and students from the [Dept. of Computer Engineering and Industrial Automation of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Campinas](https://www.fee.unicamp.br/?language=en) that are currently developing projects using immersive technologies in the context of data visualization and analysis.

## Motivation

Our main goal is to contribute with the `Visual Analytics` and `Immersive Analytics` fields by exploring how the characteristics of immersive technologies can be used to provide a better experience of visualizing and analyzing data.
